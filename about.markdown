Since my school years, I've been passionate about creating software that people enjoy using. With over 20 years of experience in IT, I've developed strong skills as an engineer. For the past decade, my main focus has been on implementing DevSecOps/SRE practices on top of Clouds and Container orchestration systems. I have extensive expertise in implementing various Cloud solutions, automating the software development life cycle (SDLC), and managing IT services. I'm able to deliver robust solutions for monitoring, managing, and automating IT infrastructure with ease. Iâ€™m profoundly knowledgeable about: 

* SLDC: Implement and manage continuous delivery systems and methodologies
* Implement and automate security controls, governance processes, and compliance validation
* Define and deploy monitoring, metrics, and logging systems
* Implement systems that are highly available, scalable, and self-healing
* Design, manage, and maintain tools to automate operational processes
* Services Management using ITIL
* microservices approach, cloud native applications, 12factor apps
* Clouds: AWS/OpenStack. Infrastructure as Code with Terraform and Cloud Formation
* Container Orchestration/PaaS: CloudFoundry, Kubernetes, Rancher, Docker Compose
* Scripting languages: Python
* Configuration management tools: Ansible

Exceptionally good communication and customer service skills with the strong problem solving and troubleshooting skills.
